We introduced so-called "Elmer Fudd" (bug hunting sessions) at
[mabl](https://mabl.com) where we gather interested folks from all
parts of the company to exercise a set of changes prior to releasing
to customers.

This helps to gauge the maturity of the changes and also helps
developers to see their work in action in a safe setting.

We put together a [template](https://www.mabl.com/blog/exploring-together-to-find-and-prevent-bugs-with-elmer-fudd-sessions) that you can also use to
setup similar events at your organization.
